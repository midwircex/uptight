## Part #14 FINAL

Ok I still get so many messages asking if we’re still together so I figured I would write another update. I apologize now that there isn’t detailed sex in this but I can’t write about 6 months worth of sex (and there has been a lot haha) so probably shouldn’t post this in gws but I didn’t know where else to post it.

So the major question. Yes. We’re still together, still having a good time. I don’t think either of us are the easiest people to be in a relationship with but we do have great chemistry and, for now, it’s enough to keep us together. I think I posted this in reply to someone but I moved out a couple of months ago. One of my good friends had a spare room and I thought it would probably be a good idea to move out. When we first began our “official” relationship I told Nicole that I wanted us to keep our own space but that didn’t last very long. Of course, a lot of the time it was pretty nice going to bed and waking up with her everyday but she is a difficult person to live with. I did try to be a better roommate but she definitely has different standards when it comes to cleanliness and stuff – I am more and more convinced she has OCD or something.

She didn’t take it too well when I told her I was moving out – she took it very personally. Which I guess it kind of was but I did it partly for us, I don’t think I could have coped living with her for much longer – I’m still not very good at dealing with her when she’s stressed. So we went through a real rocky patch then, she still can be a little irrationally crazy and dramatic. Sometimes I enjoy it because it keeps things fun (if that makes sense) but she nearly pushed me to my limit. She really fucking knows how to piss me off but I’m obviously good at pissing her off too.

Anyway, she got over it and I would say the relationship is a LOT better now. The sex is just as good – maybe we don’t do it quite as regularly because of the not living together but I actually think that has made it better. We were both probably putting less effort in and it was maybe getting a bit repetitive but it was still good, just not as good as it had been at the start.

Ok I’ll give you a short sex story. One night I visited her at work – she was working the late shift and she told me she wouldn’t come to my place when she finished because she would be too tired. I was a little bit annoyed because I was fucking horny that night and I thought I would be rewarded for visiting her at work. Then she told me she had an idea and on her half hour break I fucked her in the staff room. She rode me as I was sat on a chair and we kept most of our clothes on so if someone came in we might have got away with it – no one did but it was hot. That’s what’s still really great – the spontaneous stuff and for sure the sex with her is the best I’ve had.

So that’s the quick update. In summary: still together, sex still good, she’s still a little bit crazy but it’s all fun haha. Don’t really know what else to say apart from stop asking me for pictures.
