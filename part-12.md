## Part #12

I didn’t speak at all to Nicole while she was away but when she got back from NZ on Wednesday everything seemed normal - there was no mention of the argument we had last week. I got back from work and was just sat in the lounge watching TV when she came through. There was some small talk - I asked how her week had been etc. She surprised me a little by coming and sitting right on top of me and started to tell me how bad it had been. I listened for a bit but she was going on and on about how she hated home and her family and I got bored so I put my hands up her shirt and began feeling up her tits. She didn’t really react and just kept talking, even when I pulled off her shirt. We did make out for a bit and I took off her bra and she took off my shirt but then we started just talking again.

So we were both sat there without our shirts on, not actually doing anything - only talking but then Rebecca walked in. Both the girls were like “oh my god” and Rebecca just said sorry and left. Nicole looked at me, blushing, and said “oh my god that was so embarrassing”, which it was but there was something kind of fun about it as well and I was getting turned on. We started making out again but when I slipped my hand down her pants she pulled it away and was like “we can’t do it here now”.

So I grabbed her hand, took her to my room, pushed her on the bed and we started kissing as we were grinding up against each other. I moved down and began kissing her neck before I moved down further and gave her tits some attention – at the same time she was unzipping my pants and started to rub my dick. I pushed one of my hands into her underwear and feeling how wet she was I didn’t want to wait any longer so I quickly pulled her jeans off and buried my face between her legs. She was loudly moaning as I tongued her clit but then she suddenly pushed her knees against my face and was like “stop. I have to tell you something”. I looked up at her and she told me; “I had sex with someone else when I was away”.

It didn’t really bother me – we have not talked about being exclusive or anything but it was not what really wanted to hear as I was eating her out and I don’t know why she felt she had to tell me right then. I replied “Ok. Well we for sure should start using condoms again” and started going down on her again. She then said “is that all you’re going to say?” - I think she wanted a reaction from me and I didn’t want to give her one so I said “yes, now shut up”. I pushed my hand down on her chest to get her to lie down properly again and continued to eat her out until she came – she didn’t say a word apart from the occasional “fuck” when I sucked really hard on her clit.

I then moved up so I was straddling her and put my hands on the back of her head to pull her face towards my dick. She gave me an enthusiastic blowjob as I then put one of my hands behind me to start rubbing and fingering her pussy. It was so good she got me really hard really quick so I moved off her to go grab a condom. Without me saying anything she turned around so I could fuck her doggy style, which also gave me a great view of her ass. We started to fuck right away, no hesitation, and I grabbed hold of her shoulder to give me force to fuck her with. Wearing a condom, it definitely made me take longer and I pushed her down so she was lying flat on her stomach, which made her pussy feel even tighter and it didn’t me long to cum after we changed position.

After we finished we were both lying in bed when she said “can we talk now?”. So we did. I’m not going to tell you everything that was said but she did tell me that she felt guilty that she had slept with someone else (apparently he was her ex-boyfriend). In some ways it was a relief to finally talk about us but I’m still really not sure where we’re at, though we are spending more time with each other. On Friday night Rebecca was out with her boyfriend so Nicole and I stayed in. We watched a movie and every so often I would put my hand up her shirt or between her legs and we would kiss a little but then she would push me away and say she was watching the film – just to be a tease.

As soon as it was over I turned to her and straight away we started making out – I was lying on top of her and she wrapped her legs around me. We were pulling each other’s clothes off but then we decided to take it to the bedroom because we didn’t want Rebecca walking in on us again (apparently she talked to Nicole about it and told her she didn’t care if we were together but wanted us to keep it in the bedroom). So we quickly went through to her room. I sat on the edge of the bed and she sat on top, straddling me as she rubbed her hands all over my chest as we kissed - my hands squeezing her nice round ass. She then pulled my dick out my boxers and began to give me a handjob as we continued to make out and rub up against each other. I had already taken off her bra so my hands were squeezing her tits, her sensitive nipples rubbing between my fingers. Without any prompt she then got on her knees and started to suck my dick. She was doing that thing where she really tried to take it all, even though she was gagging but after a little trying she got there. It felt so good and got me so worked up, especially when she looked up at me with her sexy eyes, that I knew I would cum too soon if she continued. I told her to stop and she reached up to kiss me then whispered “ok, now you can fuck me” - it was fucking hot and I didn’t need telling twice.

She quickly found a condom and put it on me, which always makes it slightly more fun. Positioning herself on top of me she then leant forward to kiss me as she began to bounce up and down on my dick, my hands tightly gripping her ass. After a bit she changed the pace and started to grind deep into me, so that her clit was rubbing right against me. It probably felt good for her but wasn’t doing much for me so I started to thrust up and down and by the way she was moaning into my neck I definitely think she was enjoying herself. It felt fucking great but it was kind of tiring in this position, though, so I rolled her over so that I was on top and began to fuck her hard. I rubbed my hands all over her body - giving special attention to her tits and she kept giving me lots of vocal encouragement to fuck her harder. When I knew I was about to cum I pulled out, threw the condom off and shot my load all over stomach and tits.

We spent the night together and fooled around and cuddled a bit. Then the next day she came to talk to me (walked straight into my room without knocking) because I owed her some money for the Internet bill. I had genuinely forgotten I hadn’t paid it but I said sorry to her and initiated a make out session. Suddenly she pulled away and decided to have a go at me - saying something like “You’ve owed me this since before I went away and you barely apologize, don’t give me the money and then try to fuck me. Why is it always about sex with you? I’m not your fucking sex toy” and she stormed off. I don’t really know why she reacted like this over like eleven dollars. We have talked enough times now and she could have told me if she felt like this so I don’t know.

Anyway, we were both out that night (separately) and when I got back I decided to wait up for a bit because I thought if we were both drunk something would probably happen again. And it did. She got back and came straight through to the lounge - I’m sure she knew I was there. We did not speak a word to each other, though my memories are a little hazy but I remember kissing, hard, and our hands rubbing all over each other - quickly going down each other’s pants. There was really hardly any foreplay and we still had most of our clothes on when she leant over the couch and I got behind her. I pushed her dress up and her underwear down and quickly started to fuck her, forgetting that we were using condoms again and forgetting what Rebecca had said. It was over pretty quickly but I do find quick fucks like that almost as hot as longer sessions. We slept together in her bed again so there was some cuddling and stuff, and then in the morning we fucked again.

I decided to show her that it is not always about sex so I took her out for breakfast later and she did apologize for her outburst yesterday about the bill. As I said before, I’m still not really sure where we’re at - It is more than just sex now but I guess living with her meant it was never really just sex anyway. It does feel weird to admit because I’m still not really sure if we actually like each other – I start thinking I like her then she does something that pisses me off . But I guess we are basically in some kind of relationship now, just will have to see what happens.
