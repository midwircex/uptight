## Part #13

Sorry, I know I said I was going to write this yesterday and technically I did but I just got distracted and never got round to actually posting it. Also, this first part isn’t really “gone wild” but you seem to mostly want to know about the state of our relationship so that’s what I’ll write about first. It’s been a little while since my last update so I can’t write about ever interaction that we’ve had but I’ll include the important details.

This actually happened a couple of weeks ago now. I had been out and got back quite late and I thought that the girls had both gone to bed, so I decided not to contact Nicole. But then I heard someone else come back and I could tell from which room she went into that it was Nicole. I sent her a text asking if she wanted to join me and she came through almost straight away. We gave each other a look – like we know what’s going to happen and we didn’t need to say anything to each other. I was lying on my bed and she got on top, so that she was straddling me and we started to make out. Soon I was rubbing her chest and she was rubbing mine and everything seemed like it was going the way it normally does but when I tried to take her shirt off she pushed my hands away. She did the same thing when I tried again so I asked her if she was okay and we then had a conversation that went a bit like this:

Her: do you like me?

Me: yeah, of course I do

Her: I feel like you only like me because I give you convenient sex

I’m shit about talking about feelings but I do like her more than that and I do care about her and so I did tell her that. We talked for a bit then she told me that she didn’t think she could do this anymore if we weren’t monogamous and I told her I’m okay with that – I am willing to try a real relationship. I know the replies to my last post were telling me this is what she wanted but I still found it a little hard to believe she would sleep with her ex if that is really what she wanted and I said that to her. Well, that was a mistake because she then got mad at me for mentioning it and that she had already told me she felt guilty. I wasn’t going to be turned into the bad guy for bringing it up, especially when she was the one who originally told me about it – as we were having sex. We had another stupid argument, as we had both been drinking we were probably both being a bit stupid and petty but it ended with her storming out.

Anyway, the next day she was the first one to text me and was the first one to apologise. That night we talked again and basically resulted in us officially being in a relationship – I’m not going to lie, I do have some worries that it’s moving faster than I would like but that’s probably me being a typical scared-of-commitment guy. We have talked about making sure we give each other space if we need to and I did tell her that if she has a problem about something she needs to talk to me instead of having a stupid outburst. Though, there are some really nice advantages to living with your girlfriend, the sex is even more regular than it was when we just fwb. I guess it is also nice now that there is no ambiguity about what we have so we can just be open about it and go out and stuff, also, she cooks for me and we haven’t really argued, yet.

So yeah, that’s the update I’ve been getting so many requests to write and all you’re interested in is the state of our relationship then you can stop reading now but I guess I should include some “gone wild” stuff too. One time that was really hot happened on Friday night when we were out together, with some of her friends from work who I didn’t know that well. We were all squashed up together in one of those booths and everyone was nice enough but when you’re with a bunch of people you don’t really know it can get a little boring. As we were squashed up so close to each other I started rubbing Nicole’s leg. I thought she might push me away but I actually felt her spread her legs a little so I rubbed a little higher up, gently brushing over her underwear.

We all stayed talking normally as I continued rubbing between her legs then she suddenly turned to me and said “shall we go and get some drinks?”. We went to the bar and she was the one that went for it, wrapped her arms around me and started to kiss me. I guess she must have been pretty turned on because it’s not really like her to be that forward, especially in public but I definitely enjoyed it. We stood there kissing for quite a long time until we both realised we were probably getting a bit too carried away. Then she said to me “I know Rebecca won’t be at home tonight so can be as loud as we want”, giving me a really sexy smirk before going to sit back down again.

Well that sure made me want to leave right then but I had to go and join the others and pretend I was enjoying myself when all I wanted to do was go home to fuck. She was totally enjoying being such a fucking tease and now was the one subtlety rubbing my leg and batting her eyelashes at me. Also, she was wearing this shirt and I could tell that she had got no bra on underneath as I could see her nipple piercing so every time I looked at her I was getting more and more turned on. It got to a point where I couldn’t deal with the teasing anymore so I made some lame excuse that Nicole and I had to leave. In the taxi we were all over each other and I was so horny and she was being such a tease – rubbing my crotch, that I could have fucked her right there.

When you first get in to our flat her bedroom is the first you get to so as soon as we got in I practically carried her in and as we were kissing as I pushed her against her dressing table thing. All the teasing and kissing had got me so turned on and I could tell by the way she was acting that she was too. I was grinding up against her pussy as she tried to unzip my jeans, I think one of the reasons the sex is so good is that we do seem to know what each other wants without having to say it. I pushed her skirt up and I stared straight at her as I started to fuck her – it’s so hot to watch her face.

She put her hands on my face and we started to kiss as I pushed my hand up her shirt and as she wasn’t wearing a bra I got a good feel of her tits, which I roughly rubbed between my fingers. When I was getting close I started to fuck her harder and I could hear the table banging against the wall and I don’t know why but I found that quite fun and since she said we could be as loud as we wanted I decided to see how loud I could go. When I did cum the banging was really loud so I hope we didn’t annoy the neighbours haha. So after all the build-up it was over kind of quickly but it was for sure a great fuck. We both lay her on her bed for a little while to get our breath back, then she went to the bathroom to clean up.

When she got back we cuddled and talked for a bit but then things got going again and we started to take each other’s clothes off. We were fumbling around a bit like teenagers – feeling each other up, she started to give me a handjob and I fondled her tits, squeezing them and playing with her nipples. We then rolled over so that I was on top, her legs spread and my dick was gently rubbing over her pussy. We started making out again as I rubbed her clit with my fingers and as I moved down and began kissing her neck I pushed my fingers inside her. I fingered her wet pussy until she started moaning “fuck me” right into my ear.

I didn’t need asking twice and she wrapped her hand around the back of my neck as I started to fuck her. Her hand on my neck felt like she was trying to pull me in deeper so I tried to get as deep as possible by pulling nearly all the way out then pushing back in as hard as I could and the moans she made each time were so fucking hot. She dropped her own hand down to her crotch and began rubbing her clit as I continued to pound away. I grabbed hold of the head board to try and give me a bit more force to fuck her with. She suddenly said “fuck, right there” – I guess a change in the angle hit a good spot so I tried to keep it going in the same way as she rubbed her clit even harder. She then got all tense, started swearing even louder and from the way she threw her head back I’m pretty sure she was cumming. It was really hot to watch her face – it was almost like she couldn’t stand it and seeing her like that made me cum again. After, I think she wanted to cuddle a bit but I just feel asleep almostimmediately but it is nice to wake up to the view of her tits in the morning.

Sorry I was slow with the update but having a live-in girlfriend has given me a lot less time to write and she can be quite distracting haha. We’re officially together so there isn’t really much more to keep writing about and the stories are probably already getting a bit repetitive, but I am flattered in a weird way that there was this following to this interesting part of my life.
